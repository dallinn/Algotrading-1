First attempt at algotrading.

This project will analize different stocks and present (nonworking) options to buy/sell. 
Writing these algorithms without knowledge, then I will read a book I bought "Trading Systems" to compare my instinct to actual algotrading.
Mainly just for fun but perhaps I can build neural net knowledge later down the line.
